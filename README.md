# Casper
A Spigot, BungeeCord and general Java Development Library to help speed up my general development for both private, public
and general projects. 

## Can I use the Library?

You can use my library, but you must include be in the 'Authors' tag in the plugin (or bungee) YAML file. I will be providing
documentation for this very soon, upon completion. 

# Why so slow?

Casper is a library I was developing to speed up my work when freelancing for various Networks. I'm currently in employment, and would not be allowed to use it. However, I will mainly be working on Casper for my Portfolio, and I'm excited to announce that Casper has an aimed release date of <b>March 2019</b>. This is mainly due to various exams I have on due to school, and the fact that this is carried out in my spare time. 

# Planned Additions?

Besides what you can listed here, I plan to add support for <b>Nashorn Interpreted JavaScript</b> as a way to develop Minecraft. I have seen the benefits of using a system like this (Push-Deploy without restart), and would love to share this with others, but, as stated above, will be carried out in my spare time.
